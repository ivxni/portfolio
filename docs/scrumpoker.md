## 2. High-Level Features

1. **Microsoft SSO Authentication Only**  
   - Users can only sign in via Microsoft SSO for internal company usage.  
   - Once authenticated, a new user record is created in the database (if first sign-up).  
   - Access to the dashboard is only possible after successful authentication.  

2. **Dashboard**  
   - After logging in for the first time, the user is directed to the main dashboard.  
   - The dashboard initially shows a landing page with a main image (representing the game area) and two buttons:
     - **Create Room**
     - **Join Room**  

3. **Profile Page**  
   - After first-time sign-up via SSO, each user is automatically given a unique UUID.  
   - A user can set or update their nickname in the profile page.  
   - The profile page shows user details (email, nickname, etc.).  

4. **Room Management**  
   - **Create Room**:  
     - The user is redirected to a "create room" page.  
     - Only one **Game Type** is currently supported: `Fibonacci`.  
     - The user inputs a **Room Name**, then clicks **Create Room**.  
     - Each new room has:
       - A unique UUID
       - A 5-letter **Join Code** (e.g., `ABCDF`)  
     - The room creator is automatically assigned as the **Scrum Master**.  
   - **Join Room**:  
     - Users can join existing rooms by entering a valid 5-letter join code.  

5. **Scrum Poker Game**  
   - **Gameplay**:
     - Once in a room, the players see a large "table" area in the middle, containing:
       - A **Reveal Cards** button
       - A **Timer** (controlled by the Scrum Master)  
     - Around the table, each player is displayed as an **unrevealed card** until the timer ends or until the Scrum Master reveals the cards.  
   - **Estimations**:
     - Players click on a Fibonacci card (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13...) to place their estimate.  
     - While the timer is running, other players' estimates remain hidden/anonymous.  
   - **Reveal**:
     - When time runs out, or if the Scrum Master clicks the **Reveal Cards** button:
       - All selected cards become visible.
       - The app calculates and displays statistics (e.g., median, average, etc.) in a visually appealing way.  
   - **Story Ticket Description**:
     - The Scrum Master can set a description for the current story ticket in the room.  
     - All players can read it before making their estimation.  

6. **Styling and Theme**  
   - A minimalistic, modern 2025 design.  
   - Accent color: `#ea591b`  
   - Background color: `white`  
   - The game table is shown with a simple solid color.  
   - The user avatars or seats are displayed around this central table.

## 3. User Flow

Below is the typical flow from a user's perspective:

1. **Open Application**  
   - The user lands on a clean welcome screen with a button to **Sign in with Microsoft**.  

2. **Microsoft SSO**  
   - The user signs in via Microsoft SSO.  
   - If it's the first sign-in, a new user is created in the database (with a unique UUID).  
   - The user is then redirected to the main **Dashboard**.  

3. **Dashboard**  
   - Shows a simple landing page.  
   - Displays:
     - A mock or image of the game area  
     - Two main buttons: **Create Room** and **Join Room**.  

4. **Create or Join a Room**  
   - **Create Room** flow:
     1. Click **Create Room**.  
     2. On the next page, confirm the **Game Type** (only `Fibonacci` available for now).  
     3. Enter the **Room Name** (e.g. "Sprint 12 Planning").  
     4. Click **Create Room** to generate:
        - A **Room UUID**  
        - A **5-letter Join Code**  
       The user becomes the Scrum Master.  
   - **Join Room** flow:
     1. Click **Join Room**.  
     2. Enter a valid 5-letter join code.  
     3. Click **Join** to be placed into that room's game session.  

5. **Gameplay**  
   - Upon joining a room, the user sees:
     - A central table area with a **Reveal Cards** button.  
     - A **Timer** (start/pause/reset) controlled by the Scrum Master.  
     - Seats/avatars around the table representing each player.  
   - **Placing Estimates**:
     - Each user clicks a card with a Fibonacci number to make their estimate.  
     - Cards remain hidden to others until the reveal phase.  
   - **Revealing Estimates**:
     - When the timer expires or the Scrum Master clicks **Reveal Cards**, all estimates flip face-up.  
     - A quick **statistics panel** appears (e.g., median, average, highest, lowest).  

6. **Profile Page**  
   - After first sign-up, the user can visit their profile to set or change their nickname.  
   - The profile page also shows their email (pulled from Microsoft SSO) and user UUID.

## 4. Tech Stack Overview

1. **Frontend (React)**  
   - **React** for building user interfaces.  
   - **React Router DOM** for client-side routing (dashboard, create room, join room, profile, etc.).  
   - UI styling:
     - Accent color: `#ea591b`
     - White background
     - Minimalistic "2025 style"  
   - **Socket.io client** for real-time game communication.  

2. **Backend (Node.js & Express)**  
   - **Express** for handling RESTful endpoints (room creation, user creation, etc.).  
   - **Socket.io server** for handling real-time events (players joining, placing estimates, revealing cards).  
   - **JWT** tokens for session management after Microsoft SSO.  
   - **MongoDB** for data persistence (users, rooms, estimates).  

3. **Environment Variables (.env)**  
   - **PORT**: the port your server listens on (e.g., `4000`).  
   - **JWT_SECRET**: a secret key for JWT signing.  
   - **MONGODB_URI**: the URI for connecting to MongoDB.  
   - **MICROSOFT_SSO_CONFIG**: any required Microsoft SSO client ID, client secret, redirect URI, etc.  
   - Make sure not to commit these variables to version control.

## 5. Application Flow in Detail

1. **Authentication with Microsoft SSO**  
   - The user is redirected to the Microsoft login page.  
   - On successful login, Microsoft sends the user back to the app with an auth token.  
   - The backend verifies the token and issues a **JWT** to the user.  
   - The app checks if the user exists in MongoDB (by email or Microsoft ID):
     - If not, create a new user document (including a unique UUID).  
     - Return user data + the newly created or existing user's doc.  

2. **Dashboard & Room Navigation**  
   - The user's browser local storage/session stores the JWT.  
   - The React frontend queries the backend to validate the JWT and fetch user profile info.  
   - If valid, the user can see the dashboard.  
   - The user can choose **Create Room** or **Join Room**.  

3. **Room Creation**  
   - The React frontend sends a request to the **/createRoom** endpoint with:
     - `roomName`
     - `gameType` (Fibonacci)  
   - The backend:
     - Generates a UUID for the room.  
     - Generates a 5-letter join code.  
     - Stores the room in MongoDB.  
     - Responds with the room data.  
   - The user is redirected to the newly created room's page.  
   - A Socket.io room is also created under the hood, allowing new players to join.  

4. **Join Room**  
   - The user enters a 5-letter join code.  
   - The React frontend sends a **/joinRoom** request with the code.  
   - The backend finds the corresponding room by code and returns the room data if valid.  
   - The user is then connected via Socket.io to that specific room's channel.  

5. **Gameplay**  
   - **Timer**:
     - Controlled by the Scrum Master (creator of the room).
     - All participants see a synced countdown or running clock.  
   - **Estimation Phase**:
     - Each user selects a Fibonacci card.  
     - The selection is sent to the server via Socket.io (invisible to others until reveal).  
     - The server keeps track of each user's estimate.  
   - **Reveal Phase**:
     - When the timer ends or the Scrum Master triggers "Reveal Cards":  
       - The server broadcasts a "reveal" event.  
       - Each client flips the cards face-up, showing the estimates.  
       - A statistic panel (median, average, etc.) is computed server-side or client-side and displayed.  

6. **Profile Page**  
   - Accessible via a navigation link (e.g., `/profile`).  
   - The user sees their email and can edit their nickname (sent to the server to update).  
   - The new nickname is stored in MongoDB and used in the game sessions (avatars, scoreboard, etc.).  

---

## 6. Real-Time Mechanics (Socket.io)

To provide instantaneous updates for all players, the app uses Socket.io:

1. **Connect**: When a user enters a room, the client emits a "joinRoom" event with the room ID or join code.  
2. **Broadcast**: The server notifies all other participants of a new user's arrival.  
3. **Estimation**: When a user selects a card, the client emits an "estimate" event with the selected value.  
4. **Reveal**: When the Scrum Master triggers reveal or the timer ends, the server emits a "revealCards" event.  
5. **Updates**: Users see immediate changes as other players join, leave, or place new estimates.  

---

## 7. Security Considerations

- **JWT Authentication**:  
  - Protect routes to ensure only authenticated users can access the dashboard or create rooms.  
- **Microsoft SSO**:  
  - Use official Microsoft OAuth libraries and store required keys/tokens in `.env`.  
- **Access Control**:  
  - Only the Scrum Master should be able to manipulate the timer or reveal cards.  
- **Secure WebSockets**:  
  - Socket.io connections should be authorized via the user's JWT.  

---

## 8. Conclusion

This Scrum Poker application streamlines story point estimation with a clean, modern interface and real-time interaction. By focusing on Microsoft SSO for authentication, the system remains secure and limited to internal usage. The combination of React, Node.js/Express, and Socket.io provides a highly responsive user experience, while MongoDB ensures flexibility for user and room data storage.

For further implementation details, refer to the project's individual documentation for:

- **Endpoints & Controllers** (REST API in Node.js/Express)  
- **React Components & Routing** (frontend with React Router DOM)  
- **Socket Events & Handlers** (real-time architecture)  
- **Database Schemas** (MongoDB models) *(excluded for now, but define them in a dedicated document or folder when needed)*
